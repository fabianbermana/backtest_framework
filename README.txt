# Backtest Framework

This project is a backtest framework designed to help you test trading strategies. It allows you to simulate trades and evaluate the performance of your strategies over historical data.

## Features

- Simulate a trader that acts over discrete time-steps, and can only see data that has been realized up to the current time steps
- Compute the returns generated by the trader's trading strategy
